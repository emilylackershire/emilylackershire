## hello! 

My name is Emily Lackershire (she/her) and I am currently a second year at Grinnell College were I am studying Computer Sciene and Statistics. I am also a member of the Womens golf team there!

I'm currently working on a project in R to analyze trackman data or stats from a round of golf, with the hopes of making it very accessable. I also am working on many smaller projects. 

I am currenlty trying to learn Java!

I have experience in  R, RStudio, C, LaTex, Overleaf, Scheme, Racket and Python.

Projects posted on here are my own, and are not for classes.
