## hello! 

My name is Emily Lackershire (she/her) and I am currently a third year at Grinnell College were I am studying Computer Sciene and Statistics. I am also a member of the Womens golf team there!

I am currently doing research in network science under professor Nicole Eikmeier of Grinnell College, and we are primarily working in python!

I'm also working on a project in R to analyze trackman data or stats from a round of golf, with the hopes of making it very accessable. I also am working on many smaller projects. 

I have experience in  R, C, Java, Python, LaTex, Scheme, and Racket.

Projects posted on here are my own, however some of them may be in collaboration with peers, for my research, or for my object-oriented programming class last semeseter!
